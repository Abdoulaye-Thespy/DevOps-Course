- Not enough to work as Developer, Engineer, DevOps.
- it will not be enough to obtain a cloud role, bit it can help shorlist our resume.

TIME required: 50 hours.(beginner), 30 (hours), intermediate, 10 hours(Professionals)

# What to do ?
1) Video and notes
2) follow hands on lab and memorize key information
3) practise exam.

# Exam Guide (4)

# cloud computing
- No server on premise.
- Internet access.

# Cloud hosting.
- Before, 1995, to host a website, you needed a dedicated server.
- Then came Virtual private server, with the concept of virtulisaiton
- Shared hosting (namecheap, hosgator), this was just folders with specific permission.
- Cloud hosting (Elastic, many services. include the previous type of hosting)
# Cloud patforms and cloud service providers.
- CSP provide many services and we can have IAC
- landscape of CSP (3 tiers)
# Services from CSP
AWS has 200+ services falling into the following goups.
- Compute.
- Networking
- Storage
- Databses

 # Evolutiton of Computing
 - Dedicated
 - VM
 - Containers
 - Functions

 1. SaaS
 - Gmail
 - Salesforce
 - Office 365

 2. PaaS (for developer, just deploy your code)
 - Heroku, EB, Netlify
 3. IaaS(CSPs)

 # Deployment models
 - Public Cloud
 - Private
 - Hybrid 
 - Cross-cloud (Mutiple cloud provider)

 # Benefit of the cloud


# Global infrastructure
1. Regions Combination of AZs.
2. one or more more datacenters, they are choosen using subnets. 
3. some services are global. 

# fault tolerance

# Global network
- internconnections between AWS global infrascructure
- referred to as The backbone of AWS.
- edge location on and off rams to global network
- POP (point of presence), edge location or Regional Edge Caches.
- AWS direct connect
- Local zones
- AWS wavelentgh
- Data residency
- AWS for govnerment
- Govcloud(US)
- AWS China (Isolated, threated like a complete chineze AWS, with a different domain)
- Sutainability 
- AWS Groundstation 
- AWS Outpost

# Cloud Architecture Terminologies
- High availability
  - run services on multiple availability zones. Use ELB to distribute traffic
- High scalability
  - Increase capacity bases on increasing demand.
  - Scake up/vertical scaling means incresing memory and CPU
  - Scale out/Horizontal scaling.
- Elasticity
  - Automatically increase or decrease capacity
  - Autoscaling Group
- Higly fault tolerant
  - no single point of failure.
- high durability
- Business continuity plan (PCP)
- architectural diagram

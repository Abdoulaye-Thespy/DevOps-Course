# Becoming a Cloud Prationner Part 1
## Module 1: Introduction to Amazon Web Services
- Topic A: Understanding of networks
    - IP
    - Subnets
    - Routing
    - NAT (Network Adress Translation)
        - It is a technique used to translate private IP addresses within a local network to a public IP address
    - Virtual Private Network (VPN)
        - It is a secure connection established over the internet that allows remote users to access a private network as if they were directly connected to it. 
    - Load balancers 
    - Domain Name System (DNS)
    - ISP
    - Network security mesasures (NOTE: Need furter study)
        - Firewall
        - IDS, IPS (Intrusion detection system, ...)
- Topic B: Cloud computing benefits
    - Scalability
        - ability to scale
    - cost efficienty
    - Accessibility and Mobility
    - High Reliability and Availability
    - Automatic Software Updates
    - Security and Data Protection
    - Innovation and Agility
    - Environmental Sustainability
## Module 2: Global Infrastructure and Reliability
- Topic A: Global infrastructure
    - Regions
    - AZs
    - Point of Presence (POP)
        - Network presence to reduce latency and optimize data routing.
    - Edge Location
    - Regional Edge Caches
## Module 3: Networking (NOTE: Need a demo)
- Topic A: Amazon Virtual private cloud.(Interactive demo)
    - AWS Direct Connect
    - AWS Transit Gateway
    - Route 53
- Topic B: Network Access Lists (ACLs) with security groups (SGs) (Interactive demos)
    - Network Access Lists (ACLs): 
      Network ACLs act as a firewall at the subnet level
    - Security Groups (SGs).
      Security Groups are stateful firewalls that control traffic at the instance level. 

## Module 4: Object storage
- Topic A: Object storage with Amazon S3
    - Object storage is a storage architecture that stores data as objects, each consisting of data, metadata, and a unique identifier.


## EC2 pricing
- On demand (pay per hour)
- Saving plan (make a commitment and get a discount)
- Spot instance (Bid on unused EC2 capacity, get  up to 90% compared to On-Demand pricing)
- Reserved (Pay upfront and make a commitment to get a huge discount)
- Dedicated hosts (separate pricing)
